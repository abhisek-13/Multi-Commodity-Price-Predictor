# Multi-Commodity Price Predictor

## Overview
The Multi-Commodity Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the prices of various commodities, specifically cars, bikes, and laptops. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate price predictions based on user inputs. The project includes a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model and obtain price predictions for each commodity.

## Features
- **Car Price Prediction:** Input car-specific details and get an estimated price.
- **Bike Price Prediction:** Input bike-specific details and get an estimated price.
- **Laptop Price Prediction:** Input laptop-specific details and get an estimated price.
- **Streamlit Interface:** A clean and intuitive interface for each commodity, making it easy for users to input data and view predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for model development.
- **Machine Learning:** Algorithms and models for price prediction.
- **Streamlit:** Framework for building the user interface.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-commodity-price-predictor.git
    cd multi-commodity-price-predictor
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
